# Getting Started with react-chrome-extension

This is a starting template for developing react chrome extension with Webpack.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the extension for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your extension is ready to use!

### `npm run dev`

Builds the extension for production to the `dist` folder every time you change something in your code (--watch option)./
